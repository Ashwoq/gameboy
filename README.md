# Previous Work - PORTAL V4

Previously, I used Blender and Three.js to create my first 3D website. You can check it out [here](https://portal-v4.vercel.app/).

# Current Project - GAMEBOY AD

I recently started working on a new 3D project using Spline. This project represents my first foray into using Spline for 3D web design. You can view this project [here](https://gameboy-ad.web.app/).

# Future Learning Goals

I aim to enhance my skills with Spline by diving deeper into various aspects including:

- Materials
- Physics
- Camera Movement
- States and Variables
- Optimization

I am committed to improving my proficiency and understanding of these concepts to create even more engaging and optimized 3D experiences.
